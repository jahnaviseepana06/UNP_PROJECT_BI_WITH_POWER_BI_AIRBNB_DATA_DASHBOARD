The dataset contains 48,895 Airbnb listings from New York City.
It  provides crucial insights into pricing, availability, reviews, and host performance. It highlights key trends in high-demand locations, pricing strategies, and customer engagement, helping hosts optimize their listings and maximize profitability.
The Airbnb dataset provides a structured view of short-term rental listings, focusing on hosts, locations, pricing, availability, and guest engagement. It includes host details (Host ID, Host Name) to identify property owners and their activity levels. Location attributes (Neighborhood Group, Neighborhood, Latitude, Longitude) help in geographic analysis of listings. Property characteristics (Room Type, Price) define the type of accommodation and its cost per night. Booking details (Minimum Nights, Availability 365) indicate how frequently a listing is open for reservations. Guest engagement metrics (Number of Reviews, Last Review, Reviews per Month) provide insights into listing popularity and customer feedback trends. Additionally, the Calculated Hard Listing Count helps track the number of active listings managed by each host. This dataset is useful for analyzing market trends, pricing strategies, customer behavior, and listing availability patterns. This dataset serves as a powerful tool for Airbnb hosts and analysts to understand market trends, optimize listings, and maximize profitability.This project was successfully complete with the guy of UNP(United Nation of Professionals).All the necessary documents and dashboards have been uploaded to gitHUB for further reference.
